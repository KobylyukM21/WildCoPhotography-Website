                <h3 id="IntoH"> Hi I’m Emily!</h3>
                <p> Since I will be asking you a million questions to get to know you, I figured you'd
                    like to know some stuff about me too! So, let me tell you a little bit more about myself…
                    I’m a 22 year old girl who was born in Philadelphia PA. I was raised in Florida and moved 
                    to Ohio when I was 15 years old. Ever since I got my first phone I took pictures of everything- and I mean EVERYTHING. 
                    It wasn’t until later, after I settled down in Ohio, I realized I had a passion for photography and it blossomed from there! 
                    This started off as a hobby for me. I was taking photos of my friends and family and I realized I wanted to do this forever. Since 
                    then, God has blessed me with so many opportunities to grow further in my business. It is all because of him! 
                </p>
